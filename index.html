      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Mel, and I'm seeking a career change after leaving
        my job as a secondary school teacher.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in London and grew up in Hertfordshire, 
        but I've been living in Birmingham since I started my 
        degree. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I've been known to hop from hobby to hobby quite fleetingly.
        I've tried ice skating, skydiving, crafting, LARPing and 
        tabletop gaming. I also enjoy playing video games, especially
        co-op games with friends. 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to see myself as a Full Stack Web Developer
        after finishing this course.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Selly Oak, Birmingham. There are some great restaurants 
        around here!
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want a job where I can be logical and creative at the
        same time. I love solving problems, and I'm excited to be 
        joining such a rapidly growing sector.
